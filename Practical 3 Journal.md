# **Week 2 - Learning about WordPress**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

In the third week of the semester, I set up my website, OrbitGames, using WordPress on InfinityFree. The process was similar to my experience with Joomla in Week 2, but this time, I relied on WP Builder forums and YouTube tutorials for guidance. These resources provided useful tips and tricks for customizing my site, including theme selection, plugin usage, and layout adjustments to better fit my vision for OrbitGames.

One of the main challenges I encountered was an issue with my SSL certificate, which didn’t work properly with my original domain. After troubleshooting, I had to switch to a different domain name and use an alternative SSL provider to secure my website. While this was an unexpected hurdle, it gave me a better understanding of website security and the importance of SSL certificates in establishing a trusted online presence.

Compared to Joomla, I found WordPress to be more user-friendly and efficient. The interface was cleaner, and the elementor editor made customization much easier. Moving forward, I plan to explore more plugins to enhance my website’s functionality and continue refining OrbitGames’ design to create a more engaging user experience.

Compared to Joomla, WordPress felt more intuitive, making it easier to adjust layouts and manage content.

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

Working with WordPress introduced me to a range of tools that can be valuable for future projects. Features like the elementor editor, plugin integration, and theme customization provided hands-on experience in building and managing websites efficiently. The ability to create dynamic content and enhance user interaction with minimal coding is especially useful for game development, where online presence and engagement are important. Learning WordPress has also improved my adaptability and problem-solving skills, which will help me navigate different web development platforms in the future.
