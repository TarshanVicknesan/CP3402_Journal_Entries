# **Week 2 - Overview of CMSs (Joomla) **

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

In the second week of the semester, I focused on setting up my website using Joomla as a content management system (CMS) and hosting it on InfinityFree. My workflow began with creating a domain on InfinityFree to establish my website’s online presence. To guide me through the process, I used both a tutorial and a website that outlined similar steps for setting up hosting and installing Joomla.
After setting up the domain, I followed the instructions to download and install the Joomla CMS extension. Next, I needed to configure a MySQL database to store my website’s content and settings. Using both the tutorial and the website guide, I successfully set up the database, linked it to Joomla, and completed the installation process. With everything properly configured, I was able to access Joomla’s interface and start editing my website.
Joomla provides pre-built templates and extensions, so I explored different themes to find one that suited my project. I also experimented with Joomla’s module system to add and configure various site elements. While working with Joomla, I encountered challenges in managing articles, menus, and customization options. To overcome these difficulties, I referred back to the tutorial, the website guide, and Joomla’s documentation to learn how to structure and edit my website effectively.
One key improvement I aim to make is refining my website’s layout by further customizing Joomla’s default settings. Additionally, I plan to integrate more interactive elements using Joomla extensions to enhance user experience.

## **Content Insights**

This week, I learned how to set up web hosting and use Joomla as a CMS. Setting up a domain, configuring a MySQL database, and installing Joomla required careful attention to detail. While Joomla made website creation easier, I still had to learn how to manage and customize templates effectively. My website is functional, but I want to refine the layout and explore more customization options.

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

I gained valuable experience in web hosting and database management. Setting up Joomla and troubleshooting issues improved my problem-solving skills. Working with new tools like InfinityFree and Joomla also strengthened my ability to adapt. These skills will help me develop better workflows and expand my knowledge of web-based technologies, which are important for my future in game development.
