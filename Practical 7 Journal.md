# **Week 7 - PHP Programming**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

In Week 7, the task was to learn PHP and complete all the requirements for the project. The goal was to create a simple blog website where posts could be displayed, new posts could be added, and the data could be stored in a JSON file. I started by learning the basics of PHP, such as syntax, variables, and functions, using the tutorial from W3Schools. I learned how to echo HTML content, use if/else statements for decision-making, and use loops like foreach to display data. I also learned about file handling in PHP, like reading from and writing to a JSON file using file_get_contents() and file_put_contents().

To get the website running, I set it up on my localhost using Apache. This allowed me to view and test the website in a local environment. As I moved forward, I applied what I learned to build the blog website. I used PHP to display blog posts from the posts.json file and created a form to let users add new posts. To make the website easier to manage, I used the include() function to add the same header and footer to different pages. I also used CSS to style the website, making it look good and user-friendly. Throughout the project, I tested the website to make sure everything worked, using W3Schools as a helpful guide for learning PHP.

Additionally, I learned how to style the site using CSS to improve user experience.

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

Building this project has improved my web development skills, especially in server-side programming with PHP. I gained hands-on experience setting up a local server using Apache, which is an important skill in the tech industry. This project also taught me how to troubleshoot and debug my code, enhancing my problem-solving abilities. Overall, these skills are valuable for roles in web development and will help me become more employable in the field.
