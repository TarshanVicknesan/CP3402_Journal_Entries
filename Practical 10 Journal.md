# **Week 10 - Presentation Rehearsals**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

In the final week of this course, our group had already completed the WordPress group assignment and moved on to rehearsing for our presentation. As per the requirements, our presentation is focused on our development workflow, rather than the website content itself. Since there are only five of us contributing to the assignment, I decided to come up with five topics related to our workflow. These topics are:

    Software & Hosting Overview – Tools and platforms we used

    Our Development Workflow – A step-by-step explanation of how we built the project

    Tool Comparisons & Workflow Justification – Why we chose this workflow over other possible approaches

    Live Workflow Demonstration – A real-time walkthrough of how our development process works

    Reflections & Future Improvements – What we’d improve or do differently next time

We then assigned one topic to each team member. After that, we voted on whether to present using slides or website tabs. We all collectively agreed on using slides and began creating simple, clear slides that could effectively support our explanations. Since the presentation is intended to last 10 minutes or less, we kept things concise.

Once the slides were completed, we discussed the structure of the presentation. Four of the topics would be presented using slides, while the Live Workflow Demonstration would be done in real-time. I also prepared the software needed to record our voices via Discord and to screen record our slides and desktop.

After setting everything up, we began our rehearsal, allowing anyone to pause and restart as needed, since it was a practice run. However, we only needed one take, as everyone was fluent with the assignment and familiar with the tools and resources we used.

Our main feedback from the rehearsal was to cut out some redundant parts and improve the live demonstration by highlighting the use of both our staging and production sites.

## **Content Insights**

Throughout this course, I’ve learned a lot about using a CMS, especially WordPress. At the beginning, I didn’t know much about how websites were made or managed without needing to code everything from scratch. But as we worked through the assignment, I started to understand how powerful and useful a CMS can be. I learned how to add and organise content, choose and customise themes, use plugins, and manage the site’s layout and design. Working in a group also helped me understand how team members can take on different roles and contribute to one project. The presentation rehearsal helped me go over everything we learned, and it reminded me how far I’ve come since the start of the course. It was a good way to reflect on what I’ve accomplished and to explain the process clearly, which made the learning experience even stronger.

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

This project helped me build important skills that will be useful for future jobs. I was involved in planning the presentation, setting up the recording tools, and guiding part of the rehearsal, which gave me good practice in organising tasks and working as part of a team. Our group worked well together we shared ideas, gave helpful feedback, and supported each other when things needed to be changed or improved. I also learned how to manage my time better and stay flexible when plans didn’t go exactly as expected. Most importantly, I improved at explaining technical processes in a clear and simple way, which is a useful skill in any job that involves teamwork, communication, or using digital tools. This experience has made me feel more confident and ready for future projects or roles in the tech and creative industries.
