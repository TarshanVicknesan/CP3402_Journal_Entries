# **Week 9 - Sass**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

In Week 9, we learned about SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets), which is a tool that makes writing CSS easier, more organized, and reusable. I used it for a university website project called Orbit University, which focuses on Game Design. To better understand SASS, I used an online guide that showed different code examples and explained how to use SASS features like variables, nesting, and mixins. This guide helped me see how others write their SCSS code, which made it easier for me to apply these ideas to my own project.

To get started with SASS, I watched a YouTube tutorial that showed me how to install it on my computer. The video explained how to set it up using Node.js and npm, which are common tools for installing SASS. Once I finished the setup, I went back to the guide to check out code examples that helped me apply what I had learned to the Orbit University website. For example, I used SASS to style the navigation bar and make reusable components like cards for displaying program details.

To make my work faster, I also added the Live Sass Compiler extension to Visual Studio Code. This tool automatically changes the SASS into CSS as I make changes, so I didn’t have to do it manually every time. This made my work much quicker and easier. Using the online guide, the code examples, and the Live Sass Compiler, I was able to try out SASS features like nesting and mixins. These tools helped me create the website in a more organized and efficient way.

## **Content Insights**

Throughout Week 9, I gained valuable insights into how SASS can improve the way we write CSS. By using SASS, I was able to organize my stylesheets better, making the code cleaner and easier to maintain. The ability to use variables for colors and fonts helped me save time and ensure consistency across the website. Additionally, learning how to use mixins and nesting allowed me to write less code while achieving the same results, making my workflow much more efficient. This hands-on experience with SASS also made me realize the importance of working with tools that enhance productivity and make code more manageable, which will be helpful in future projects.

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

Learning SASS has also given me valuable skills that will benefit my career in web development and design. The ability to work with modern CSS preprocessors like SASS is an essential skill in the industry, as it allows developers to create more scalable and maintainable code. By understanding how to use SASS efficiently, I’ve enhanced my ability to work on larger projects with more complex stylesheets. Furthermore, the experience of setting up a development environment and working with tools like Visual Studio Code and the Live Sass Compiler has helped me become more comfortable with industry-standard tools. These skills will make me more employable and ready to tackle real-world web development challenges in the future.
