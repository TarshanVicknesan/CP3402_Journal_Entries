# **Week 5 - Creating a child theme on Wordpress**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

In the fourth week, I focused on setting up a local WordPress environment using XAMPP. Unlike my previous experience with hosting WordPress on InfinityFree, this setup allowed me to run WordPress directly on my computer without relying on an online hosting service. To guide me through the process, I followed a detailed tutorial on setting up a local server with XAMPP, which helped me understand the steps involved in configuring Apache and MySQL. Apache acts as a local web server for testing websites, while MySQL is used to create and store website data.

Following the tutorial, I installed XAMPP and accessed its control panel to ensure that both Apache and MySQL were running correctly. I then created a new database named "wordpress", where all website data would be stored. Next, I extracted the WordPress installation files and placed them in the htdocs folder within the XAMPP directory. Once everything was in place, I navigated to "localhost/wordpress" in my browser, which successfully led me to the WordPress installation page. From there, I linked the database, configured the necessary settings, and created login credentials for my local WordPress admin account.

At this stage, my primary goal was not to edit the website pages but to focus on learning how to host WordPress locally. I wanted to understand the fundamentals of running a self-hosted website, which could be useful for future projects. Since I was also in the midst of beginning my Assignment 1, my main priority was familiarizing myself with the local hosting process rather than diving into full website customization.

## **Content Insights**

This week, I focused on understanding how to host WordPress locally using XAMPP rather than working on website customization. Setting up a local server provided valuable insight into how WordPress operates without an external hosting service, allowing for greater flexibility in testing and development. The process of configuring Apache and MySQL helped me grasp how web servers and databases interact to store and manage site content. While I did not focus on designing or editing website pages, this foundational knowledge will be beneficial for future projects where I may need to test and troubleshoot websites locally before deploying them online.

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

Setting up a local server with XAMPP gave me valuable hands-on experience in web hosting and database management. Understanding how WordPress runs locally will help with future projects and assignments, especially in testing and troubleshooting websites efficiently. This experience also strengthened my problem-solving skills and adaptability, which are essential for web and game development.
