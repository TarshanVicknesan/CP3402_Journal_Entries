**Week 1 - Development and deployment workflows**

**Learning Activities & Resources**

In the first week of the semester, I began by watching the LinkedIn Learning video resources provided by our lecturer to gain insight into website development. Afterward, I reviewed the practical requirements on the GitHub page. Once I understood the requirements, I installed VS Code and connected my GitHub login to the software so I could submit my repository and commit all my work to GitHub.
With everything configured, I started watching YouTube tutorials to refresh my memory of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I could begin the practical work. According to the practical requirements, we had to create a simple website for an online business of our imagination. I decided to create a game store, similar to the Epic Games or Steam store. We were allowed to use Bootstrap and a website template, so to save time, I used a website called StartBootstrap.com. I selected a simple business template, which included basic web pages and had pre-configured colour components in a style.css file, saving me the trouble of finding and applying colour codes.
Even with the free template, I encountered difficulties coding HTML and JavaScript on my own. To address this, I watched a YouTube tutorial that taught viewers how to code a restaurant website. By following the tutorial, I gained more knowledge about writing HTML and JavaScript, which allowed me to edit the website and align it with the design I envisioned for my online store. One improvement I hope to make is separating the JavaScript components into a different file, as they are currently integrated into the same file as my HTML.
Once the website was complete and all the work was committed to my repository, I needed to publish and host the website using GitHub. For this, I watched a simple two-minute video tutorial on publishing a website, and I successfully completed the first task.

**Estimated Hours:**

Around 5 to 6 hours, including writing the journal entry and coding the website.

**Content Insights**

From this task, I learned that I need to improve my skills in HTML and JavaScript. However, based on the time it took me to refresh my knowledge, it shouldn’t take long to relearn the techniques and styles. Additionally, I realised the need to dedicate more time to finding suitable images for the website, as it currently looks quite bland. While the final design and layout were not exactly what I envisioned, I still appreciate the outcome and how it turned out.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

This week’s tasks highlighted the importance of learning and applying modern development tools like GitHub, which are essential for collaboration and version control. Refreshing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript also strengthened my problem-solving abilities and adaptability when working with unfamiliar code or templates. These experiences have shown me how efficient workflows and well-structured code contribute to creating high-quality projects, skills that will be crucial as I work toward my goal of becoming a game developer.
