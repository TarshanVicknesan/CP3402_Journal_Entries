# **Week 6 - Group Setup**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

In Week 6, our team focused on setting up the necessary resources for our group assignment, including GitHub, Slack, Trello, and LinkedIn. As the group leader, I created our GitHub organization and repository, then integrated GitHub with Slack using extensions that allowed us to execute commands directly within Slack. While two teammates set up the required Slack extensions, another handled Trello integration, enabling remote task management across platforms. We also ensured all team members were connected on LinkedIn, as required by the project guidelines.

During the setup process, we encountered an issue with our GitHub connection, initially attempting an incorrect direct link. After reviewing the command syntax, we corrected it using the format: /github subscribe cp3402-students/jcua-team2

This resolved the issue, allowing successful integration. With Trello properly linked, we created and managed tasks from Slack, and we confirmed that our GitHub repository was functioning correctly through test commits. With everything now operational, our team is fully prepared to move forward with the project.

## **Content Insights**

Setting up our teamâ€™s collaboration tools provided valuable insights into integrating multiple platforms for effective remote teamwork. By linking GitHub with Slack and Trello, we streamlined communication and project management, reducing the need for constant manual updates. This experience reinforced the importance of proper command syntax and troubleshooting skills, as resolving the GitHub connection issue required careful review of the correct linking method. Successfully configuring these tools ensures that our workflow remains organized and efficient throughout the project.

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

This setup process enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills, particularly in configuring integrations between platforms. As the team leader, I also gained experience in delegation and team coordination, ensuring tasks were distributed efficiently. These skills are highly valuable in professional settings, where collaboration tools like GitHub, Slack, and Trello are commonly used. Additionally, resolving technical issues independently and leveraging online resources for troubleshooting strengthened my adaptability an essential skill for any future role in the tech industry.
