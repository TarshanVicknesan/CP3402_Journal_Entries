# **Week 8 - Learning Experiments**

## **Learning Activities & Resources**

During Week 7, I was learning how to use PHP, and my method of learning was by using tutorials, forums, and websites. I would look at example code, understand how it worked, and practice writing similar code. If I got stuck, I would check the answers or explanations to learn the correct way to do it. This helped me learn by seeing how things were done and repeating them until I understood.

In Week 8, we were given a task to try a different way of learning and compare it to our usual method. I decided to test if analyzing and changing PHP code without looking at explanations first (reverse engineering) would help me understand PHP better than my usual method. My idea was that by figuring out how a piece of code worked on my own, I might remember it better and understand it more deeply.

To test this, I spent 30 minutes on each method. First, I used my usual method, where I read tutorials and forums, looked at example code, and practiced writing similar code. If I had trouble, I checked the explanations to understand better. Then, I tried the new method. I took a piece of PHP code without knowing what it did, studied it, and made small changes to see how it worked. After that, I checked the explanation to see if I understood it correctly.

After trying both methods, I found that my usual method worked better for me. It helped me learn faster because I could quickly see the correct way to write PHP. The reverse engineering method made me think more, but it took too much time and slowed me down. I still think reverse engineering can be useful for harder topics, but for now, I will keep using my usual method since it helps me learn PHP more easily.

## **Steps of the Scientific Method**

Hypothesis:
In Week 8, we were asked to try a new way of learning and compare it to our usual method. I thought that reverse engineering PHP code—where I would analyze and change the code without first looking at explanations—might help me understand PHP better and remember it more than my usual way of learning with tutorials and forums.

Test:
To test this idea, I spent 30 minutes on each method. First, I used my usual approach: reading tutorials, checking forums, looking at example code, and writing similar code. If I got stuck, I would check explanations to understand better. Then, I tried the reverse engineering method, where I picked a piece of PHP code I didn’t understand, studied it, and made changes to see how it worked. Afterward, I checked the explanation to make sure I got it right.

Results:
After trying both methods, I found that my usual method worked better for me. It helped me learn PHP faster because I could quickly see the right way to write the code. The reverse engineering method made me think more, but it took longer and slowed me down. While reverse engineering might help with harder topics, for now, I will stick with my usual method since it’s easier and faster for me.

## **Content Insights**

This week, I learned that my usual method of learning PHP, which involves reading tutorials, reviewing example code, and practicing, is effective for quickly understanding the correct way to write code. I also explored reverse engineering, where I analyzed and modified code without prior explanations. Although this approach encourages deep thinking, it took more time and slowed my learning process. I discovered that while reverse engineering can be useful for complex topics, it isn’t the best approach for every situation.

## **Career/Employability/Learning Insights**

From this experience, I gained valuable insights into my learning preferences, which will help me in future projects and my career. I realized that knowing when to apply different learning methods is key. In a professional setting, being able to quickly learn and apply new skills, like PHP, is crucial. Also, understanding that more complex tasks may require a deeper, slower approach (such as reverse engineering) will help me tackle more difficult challenges in the future. Adapting my learning strategies based on the task at hand is an important skill for continuous improvement and employability.
